# How to Switch from Gas to Electric Cooking in a Rental

### Improve your indoor air quality and lower your carbon footprint!
    
I recently moved into a rental house that has a gas stovetop and oven which are widely accepted to create unsafe levels of nitrous oxides that are particularly damaging to young children and those with asthma. To make matters worse I discovered the house has a “ductless” hood which means it does not vent to outside of the house. It attempts to “clean” the air with a charcoal filter which may work for removing grease but is not effective for nitrous oxides.

The recommended solution is to switch to electric cooking sources which produce negligible levels of nitrous oxides and have the additional benefit of having a lower lifetime carbon footprint as we decarbonize the grid.

Obviously this can be problematic in a rental property where you do not have control over the appliances and venting. I put a case to the landlords but they were not receptive, so I took matters into my own hands (within the constraint of being in a rental!).

To replace the stovetop I purchased a double burner portable induction stovetop (Duxtop BT-350DZ) and a stovetop cover. I also needed to upgrade some of my cookware to be compatible with induction technology.
