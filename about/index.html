	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm a Product Manager, husband and father based in Colorado, USA.</p>

	<p>I enjoy spending time with my family, continually learning, hiking, music and more.</p>

	<h3>Brief Career Summary</h3>
	<p>I began as a Market Risk Manager at Barclays Investment Bank but longed for more impactful work and to 
		experience the world. 
		This led me to a microfinance institution in Accra, Ghana. I spent just under a year there - handling a "run on the bank" 
		whilst enjoying the culture, country and beer. Late one night I had to withdraw my own cash and head to a branch 
		to (rightfully) pay clients who'd locked staff into the branch, as they couldn't withdraw their money - wild! 
		It was a humbling, eye-opening experience that I would recommend to anyone.
	</p>
	<p>Whilst there, I discovered the emerging off-grid solar industry, trying to solve the problem that more than 1 billion 
		people don't have grid electricity access. I spent an incredible two years as fourth employee at off-grid 
		solar startup <a href="https://www.meshpower.co.rw/" target="_blank">MeshPower</a> where I first delved 
		into Product Management (and much more). We connected around 5,000 people to our microgrids and provided them with 
		lighting, phone charging, radios and more
	</p>
	<p>Most recently I was Head of Product at <a href="https://www.thg.com/" target="_blank">THG Plc</a>, 
		leading a team of 16 Product Managers building a SaaS ecommerce platform that operated at scale.
		In 2021, it received more than 1 billion visits to sites on the platform with over $2 billion GMV 
		passing through the checkout. </p>
